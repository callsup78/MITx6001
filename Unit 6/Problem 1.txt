Problem 1

Problem 1-1
The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns the correct answer.
Correct: False


Problem 1-2
When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one with the largest 
growth rate.
Correct: True


Problem 1-3
Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity
Correct: False


Problem 1-4
For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps has better time complexity (takes 
less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5 steps
Correct: True
