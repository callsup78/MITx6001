Problem 3

For each of the following expressions, select the order of growth class that best describes 
it from the following list: 𝑂(1),𝑂(log(𝑛)),𝑂(𝑛),𝑂(𝑛log(𝑛)),𝑂(𝑛𝑐) or 𝑂(𝑐𝑛). Assume 𝑐 is some constant.


1:
0.0000001𝑛+1000000
Correct: O(n)


2:
0.0001𝑛2+20000𝑛−90000
Correct: O(n^c)


3:
20𝑛+900log(𝑛)+100000
Correct: O(n)


4:
(log(𝑛))2+5𝑛7
Correct: O(n^c)


5:
𝑛200−2𝑛30
Correct: O(n^c)


6:
30𝑛2+𝑛log(𝑛)
Correct: O(n^c)


7:
𝑛log(𝑛)−3000𝑛
Correct: O(n log(n))


8:
3
Correct: O(1)


9:
5𝑛+𝑛5+𝑛+5
Correct: O(c^n)


10:
𝑛log(𝑛)+𝑛2+𝑛+log𝑛+1+2𝑛
Correct: O(c^n)
