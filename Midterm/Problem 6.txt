Implement a function that meets the specifications below.

def max_val(t): 
    """ t, tuple or list
        Each element of t is either an int, a tuple, or a list
        No tuple or list is empty
        Returns the maximum int in t or (recursively) in an element of t """ 
    # Your code here

For example,

    max_val((5, (1,2), [[1],[2]])) returns 5.
    max_val((5, (1,2), [[1],[9]])) returns 9.


def max_val(t):
    new_list = []

    for a in t:
        if type(a) == int:
            new_list.append(a)
        else:
            for i in a:
                if type(i) != int:
                    for e in i:
                        new_list.append(e)
                else:
                    new_list.append(i)

    return (max(new_list))
