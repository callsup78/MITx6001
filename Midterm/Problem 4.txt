Problem 4

Write a Python function that returns the sublist of strings in aList that contain fewer than 4 characters. For example, if aList = ["apple", "cat", "dog", "banana"], your function should return: ["cat", "dog"]

This function takes in a list of strings and returns a list of strings. Your function should not modify aList.

def lessThan4(aList):
    '''
    aList: a list of strings
    '''
    # Your code here
    



aList=[]
def lessThan4(aList):
    list1=[]
    for i in aList:
        if len(i) < 4:
            list1.append(i)
    return list1
result = lessThan4(aList)
print(result)
